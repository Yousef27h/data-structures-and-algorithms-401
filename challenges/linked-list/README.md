## Challenge

Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created. The class should contain the following methods

- insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
- to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

# Class 06

## Challenge


- append
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- insert before
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

- insert after
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

# Class 07
# Challenge Summary
This is extending an impementation problem, we take input k, which is a number repesents the place starting from tail of the linked list, and returns the value of the node at that place.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
To run the code you can either open the "App.java" file in "main" folder
and test it there, or you can simply run the "test" folder which contains multiple tests
