# Class 05

## Challenge

Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created. The class should contain the following methods

- insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
- to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

# Class 06

## Challenge


- append
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- insert before
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

- insert after
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

# Class 07
# Challenge Summary
This is extending an impementation problem, we take input k, which is a number repesents the place starting from tail of the linked list, and returns the value of the node at that place.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Solution
To run the code you can either open the "App.java" file in "main" folder
and test it there, or you can simply run the "test" folder which contains multiple tests

# Class 08

# Challenge Summary
write a function that takes two linked lists and zip them together into one so that node alternates between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.
